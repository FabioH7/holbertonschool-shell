	- Delete the file betty.
	The file betty is in /tmp/my_first_directory

##### File: [9-firstdirdeletion](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/9-firstdirdeletion)

> Delete the directory (my_first_directory) that is in the /tmp directory.

##### File: [10-back](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/10-back)

> A script that changes the working directory to the previous one.

##### File: [11-lists](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/11-lists)

> Write a script that lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format.

##### File: [12-file_type](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/12-file_type)

> A script that prints the type of the file named (iamafile). The file (iamafile) will be in the (/tmp) directory when we will run your script.

##### File: [13-symbolic_link](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/13-symbolic_link)

> Creates a symbolic link to (/bin/ls), named (__ls__). The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory.

##### File: [14-copy_html](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/14-copy_html)

> Creates a script that copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.

> Create a script that deletes all files in the current working directory that end with the character ~.

##### File: [17-tree](https://github.com/FabioH7/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/17-tree)

> Create a script that creates the directories welcome/, welcome/to/ and welcome/to/school in the current directory with just 2 lines.

> In conclusion shell scripting at most allows you to make highly advanced scripts and execute them quickly and at worst allows the user to make shortcuts of commands.

* It's pretty cool!
